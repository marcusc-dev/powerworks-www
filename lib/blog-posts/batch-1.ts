<p class="lead">One of the most common questions I get at Powerworks is "how much should a service cost?" And honestly, I understand the confusion — prices in Dubai vary wildly from AED 99 "special offers" to AED 3,000+ at the dealer. Let me break down what things really cost, and more importantly, what you should actually be getting for your money.</p>

<h2>Minor Service Costs (AED 349–600)</h2>

<p>A minor service is your routine oil and filter change, plus a basic inspection. Here's what it typically includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Engine oil and filter replacement</strong> (the quality of oil matters hugely — more on that below)</li>
  <li><strong>Visual inspection</strong> of brakes, tyres, suspension, and belts</li>
  <li><strong>Fluid top-ups</strong> — coolant, washer fluid, brake fluid check</li>
  <li><strong>Battery test</strong> — critical in Dubai's heat</li>
  <li><strong>Tyre pressure and condition check</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My honest advice:</strong> If someone is offering a "full service" for AED 99, ask what oil they're using. I've seen garages use bulk oil that doesn't meet manufacturer specs. On a modern European engine, wrong oil can cause timing chain stretch and turbo failure. The oil alone for a BMW or Mercedes costs AED 150-200.</p>

<h2>Major Service Costs (AED 800–1,500)</h2>

<p>A major service includes everything above plus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Air filter replacement</strong> — essential in dusty Dubai</li>
  <li><strong>Cabin/pollen filter</strong> — changes more often here (every 10,000-15,000km)</li>
  <li><strong>Spark plugs</strong> (if due — typically every 40,000-60,000km)</li>
  <li><strong>Brake fluid test/replacement</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Comprehensive road test</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Diagnostic scan</strong> for stored fault codes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dealer vs Independent: The Real Difference</h2>

<p>Dealer prices are typically <strong>40-60% higher</strong> than a quality independent garage. At Powerworks, we use the same specification oils and genuine or OEM-quality filters. The difference? You're not paying for a marble-floored showroom and a fleet of receptionists.</p>

<p>For example, a BMW 5 Series major service at the dealer runs AED 2,200-3,500. At Powerworks, the same service with equivalent parts is AED 900-1,200. Same quality, honest price.</p>

<h2>What to Watch Out For</h2>

<p>A few red flags when shopping for car servicing in Dubai:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prices that seem too good to be true</strong> — they usually are. Cheap oil and filters cost more in the long run.</li>
  <li><strong>No itemised invoice</strong> — always ask for a breakdown of parts and labour</li>
  <li><strong>Upselling everything</strong> — a good garage tells you what's needed now vs what can wait</li>
  <li><strong>"Genuine parts only" claims</strong> — ask to see the packaging. OEM-quality parts are often identical to genuine at 30-40% less</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">If you're reading this, your battery has probably just died — or it's showing signs. In Dubai, this isn't unusual. The extreme heat means batteries rarely last beyond 2-3 years, and I replace more batteries in the summer months than almost any other single component. Here's what you need to know about costs.</p>

<h2>Why European Cars Cost More</h2>

<p>Modern BMWs, Mercedes, and Audis require <strong>AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) batteries</strong>. These are more expensive for good reason — they handle the demands of start-stop systems, multiple electronic modules, and the constant power draw of modern luxury cars.</p>

<p><strong>Critical point:</strong> Many European cars also need <strong>battery registration</strong> (also called battery coding). This tells the car's computer that a new battery has been installed, so it adjusts the charging strategy correctly. Skip this step and your new battery may only last half as long. At Powerworks, we include coding in the price — many garages don't.</p>

<h2>Best Battery Brands for Dubai Heat</h2>

<p>I've tested dozens of brands over the years. Here's what actually survives Dubai:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bosch:</strong> My top recommendation. Excellent heat resistance, consistent quality. Silver range for standard cars, S5/S6 AGM for European.</li>
  <li><strong>Varta:</strong> Same parent company as Bosch (same factories, essentially). Slightly cheaper, same quality.</li>
  <li><strong>AC Delco:</strong> Good value for American and Japanese vehicles. Solid warranty.</li>
  <li><strong>Optima:</strong> Premium choice for high-performance vehicles. Expensive but exceptional.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My honest advice:</strong> Avoid no-name batteries from petrol stations. I've seen them fail after 6 months in Dubai heat. The AED 100 you save isn't worth being stranded on Emirates Road in August.</p>

<h2>Signs You Need a New Battery</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Slow engine cranking when starting</li>
  <li>Headlights dimming at idle</li>
  <li>Battery warning light on the dashboard</li>
  <li>Electronics acting strangely (radio resetting, windows slow)</li>
  <li>Battery is over 2 years old in Dubai</li>
</ul>

<h2>Free Battery Testing</h2>

<p>At Powerworks, we test batteries as part of every service — and we're happy to test yours for free anytime, no appointment needed. A proper load test takes 5 minutes and tells you exactly how much life is left.</p>

        question: "How much does car battery replacement cost in Dubai?",
        answer: "Car battery replacement in Dubai costs AED 299-400 for standard Japanese/Korean cars, AED 400-600 for SUVs, AED 600-1,000 for European cars (BMW, Mercedes, Audi) requiring AGM batteries, and AED 800-1,200 for luxury vehicles. These prices include fitting and old battery disposal."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do car batteries last in Dubai?",
        answer: "In Dubai's extreme heat (40-50°C for 6+ months), car batteries typically last 2-3 years compared to 4-5 years in cooler climates. Heat accelerates internal corrosion, evaporates electrolyte fluid, and increases self-discharge rates. Have your battery tested every 6 months after it reaches 18 months old."
      },
      {
        question: "What is battery coding and does my car need it?",
        answer: "Battery coding (registration) tells your car's computer that a new battery has been installed, allowing it to adjust the charging strategy. Most BMW, Mercedes, Audi, and other modern European cars require this. Without coding, the car may overcharge the new battery, significantly reducing its lifespan."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the best car battery brand for Dubai?",
        answer: "Bosch and Varta are the most reliable battery brands for Dubai's extreme heat. The Bosch Silver range works well for standard vehicles, while the S5/S6 AGM range is ideal for European cars with start-stop systems. Avoid unbranded batteries — the savings aren't worth the risk of early failure in Dubai's climate."

    category: "Buying Guide",
    date: "Feb 5, 2024",
    author: "Glenn",

<p class="lead">I can't tell you how many times someone has brought a "pristine" used car to us for a pre-purchase inspection, only for us to find it's had a significant accident. In the UAE, checking accident history is essential — and thankfully, it's become much easier than it used to be.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Dubai Police App / Website</h2>

<p>The Dubai Police Smart Services app lets you check traffic accident records for any vehicle registered in Dubai. Here's how:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the <strong>Dubai Police app</strong> or visit the website</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>"Traffic Services"</strong> then <strong>"Traffic Accident Inquiry"</strong></li>
  <li>Enter the vehicle's <strong>plate number and category</strong></li>
  <li>The report shows <strong>all recorded accidents</strong> involving that plate</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Important limitation:</strong> This only shows accidents reported to Dubai Police. Minor incidents handled through insurance directly may not appear. And if the car was previously registered in another emirate, you'll need to check there too.</p>

<h2>Step 2: MOI Smart App (Federal Level)</h2>

<p>The Ministry of Interior app covers accident records across all emirates. This is important because many cars change emirate registration during their life.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Search by <strong>chassis number (VIN)</strong> for the most comprehensive results</li>
  <li>Shows accident records regardless of which emirate they occurred in</li>
  <li>Also shows any outstanding traffic fines</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Insurance Check</h2>

<p>Ask the seller for their <strong>insurance renewal letter</strong>. If they've made claims, the insurer will have noted it. Also check if the car has been declared as a <strong>"total loss"</strong> by any insurer — some rebuilt total-loss vehicles are back on the road looking perfect but structurally compromised.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Physical Inspection Signs</h2>

<p>Even with clean records, a physical inspection reveals what databases can't. Here's what I look for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Paint thickness variation:</strong> We use a paint thickness gauge. Original paint is consistent; repainted panels show different readings</li>
  <li><strong>Panel gaps:</strong> Uneven gaps between doors, bonnet, and boot suggest body realignment after a collision</li>
  <li><strong>Welding marks:</strong> Look under the boot carpet and inside wheel arches for signs of structural welding</li>
  <li><strong>Bolt marks:</strong> Scratched or mismatched bolts on fenders, doors, or bonnet suggest panels were removed</li>
  <li><strong>Windscreen date code:</strong> If it doesn't match the car's manufacture date, it was replaced — possibly after an accident</li>
  <li><strong>Airbag warning light:</strong> If it stays on, airbags may have deployed and not been properly replaced</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 5: Professional Pre-Purchase Inspection</h2>

<p><strong>Glenn's take:</strong> Online checks are useful but they're only part of the picture. A professional inspection catches things that databases miss — structural damage, hidden repairs, mechanical issues from impact damage, and electronic problems masked by resetting warning lights.</p>

<p>At Powerworks, our pre-purchase inspection includes a full diagnostic scan, undercarriage check on the lift, paint thickness measurement, and road test. We've saved customers from some very expensive mistakes.</p>

<h2>Red Flags That Suggest Hidden Damage</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Seller reluctant to allow independent inspection</li>
  <li>Price significantly below market value</li>
  <li>Missing or incomplete service history</li>
  <li>Car is very young but sold privately (not through dealer)</li>
  <li>Multiple owners in a short period</li>
</ul>

<p>Thinking about buying a used car? Message me on WhatsApp with the details and I'll tell you if it's worth inspecting. And if you'd like us to do a full pre-purchase inspection, we can usually fit you in within 24 hours.</p>

        question: "How can I check a car's accident history in the UAE?",
        answer: "Use the Dubai Police app for Dubai-registered vehicles, or the MOI Smart app for federal records across all emirates. Enter the plate number or chassis number (VIN) to see recorded accidents. For the most thorough check, combine online records with a physical pre-purchase inspection to catch unreported damage."

      {
        question: "How much does a pre-purchase inspection cost in Dubai?",

The cost is minimal compared to discovering hidden damage after purchase."
      },
      {
        question: "Can a car have hidden accident damage with a clean police report?",
        answer: "Yes — not all accidents are reported to police, especially minor ones settled through insurance or privately. A clean police record doesn't guarantee no damage. Physical signs like paint thickness variations, uneven panel gaps, replaced windscreens, and scratched bolts can reveal unreported repairs."

<h2>Why European Cars Cost More to Repair</h2>

<p>Three reasons European repairs cost more:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Parts are more expensive</strong> — a BMW brake sensor alone costs what an entire set of Toyota pads costs</li>
  <li><strong>Labour takes longer</strong> — German engineering means more components to remove and replace</li>
  <li><strong>Specialist tools required</strong> — diagnostic software and special tooling adds to overheads</li>
</ol>

<p>That said, the gap between Japanese and European repair costs at an independent garage is much smaller than at the dealer.</p>

<h2>How to Avoid Being Overcharged</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Always get an itemised quote</strong> — parts and labour should be listed separately</li>
  <li><strong>Get 2-3 quotes</strong> for major work — but don't automatically choose the cheapest</li>
  <li><strong>Ask to see old parts</strong> — a reputable garage will show you what was replaced</li>
  <li><strong>Beware of "package deals"</strong> — sometimes they include work you don't need</li>
  <li><strong>Check Google reviews</strong> — patterns in reviews reveal a garage's true character</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Get a Second Opinion</h2>

<p><strong>My honest advice:</strong> If a garage is quoting you more than 50% above the ranges I've listed, or if they're recommending replacing components that seem fine, get a second opinion. At Powerworks, we're always happy to give you a free assessment and honest quote — even if you choose to have the work done elsewhere.</p>

<p class="lead">Tyres in Dubai face a brutal life — scorching tarmac that reaches 70°C in summer, constant speed bumps, and the occasional sandstorm. Buying the right tyres matters more here than almost anywhere else. Here's what you need to know about prices and what's worth paying for.</p>

<h2>Best Brands for Dubai Roads</h2>

<p>After years of seeing what lasts in this climate, here are my recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Michelin Primacy / Pilot Sport:</strong> My top pick. Outstanding heat resistance, excellent grip, and longest tread life in my experience. Worth the premium.</li>
  <li><strong>Continental PremiumContact / SportContact:</strong> Very close to Michelin. Excellent wet grip for those rare Dubai downpours.</li>
  <li><strong>Bridgestone Turanza / Potenza:</strong> Reliable all-rounder. Good value in the mid-to-premium range.</li>
  <li><strong>Pirelli P Zero / Cinturato:</strong> Excellent for performance cars. OE fitment on many European vehicles.</li>
  <li><strong>Hankook Ventus:</strong> Best value mid-range option. Surprisingly good heat performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Avoid</h2>

<p><strong>My honest advice:</strong> I'd steer clear of ultra-budget tyres in Dubai. Here's why:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Heat performance is poor</strong> — cheap rubber compounds break down faster in extreme heat</li>
  <li><strong>Blowout risk is higher</strong> — I see more budget tyre blowouts in summer than any other failure</li>
  <li><strong>Stopping distances are longer</strong> — the difference can be 5-10 metres at highway speed</li>
  <li><strong>They wear faster</strong> — a budget tyre lasting 20,000km vs a premium lasting 40,000km means you're not actually saving money</li>
</ul>

<p>Also avoid <strong>used or remoulded tyres</strong>. In Dubai heat, the structural integrity simply isn't there.</p>

<h2>Run-Flat vs Standard</h2>

<p>Many BMWs and Mercedes come with run-flat tyres. They cost 40-60% more than standard tyres but let you drive 80km after a puncture. If your car came with run-flats but you want to switch to standard, you'll need to carry a spare or a puncture repair kit. I can advise on what's best for your specific model.</p>

<h2>When to Replace</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tread depth below 3mm</strong> — the legal minimum is 1.6mm, but in Dubai's heat I recommend replacing at 3mm for safety</li>
  <li><strong>Age over 4-5 years</strong> — even with good tread, rubber degrades in UAE heat. Check the DOT date code on the sidewall</li>
  <li><strong>Visible cracking or bulges</strong> — replace immediately, these are blowout risks</li>
  <li><strong>Uneven wear</strong> — often indicates alignment issues (fix those first!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Need new tyres? Message me on WhatsApp with your tyre size (it's on the sidewall, e.g. 225/45R17) and I'll quote you for good quality options at fair prices.</p>

        question: "How much do tyres cost in Dubai?",
        answer: "Tyre prices in Dubai range from AED 150-250 per tyre for budget brands (sedan size) to AED 400-700 for premium brands like Michelin and Continental. SUV tyres cost AED 250-1,000 depending on size and brand. Run-flat tyres cost 40-60% more than standard equivalents. Prices include fitting and balancing."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the best tyre brands for Dubai?",
        answer: "Michelin and Continental are the best performing tyre brands in Dubai's extreme heat, offering superior heat resistance and longest tread life. Bridgestone and Pirelli are excellent alternatives. For the best value mid-range option, Hankook Ventus offers surprisingly good heat performance at a lower price point."
      },
      {
        question: "How often should you replace tyres in Dubai?",
        answer: "Replace tyres when tread depth drops below 3mm (not the legal 1.6mm minimum — Dubai's heat demands more tread for safety). Also replace tyres older than 4-5 years regardless of tread depth, as rubber degrades faster in UAE heat. Check the DOT date code on the sidewall for manufacturing date."
      },
      {
        question: "Are budget tyres safe for Dubai?",
        answer: "Budget tyres are riskier in Dubai due to poor heat resistance, higher blowout risk in summer, and longer stopping distances. They also wear faster — a budget tyre lasting 20,000km vs a premium lasting 40,000km means similar cost over time. For safety in Dubai's extreme conditions, mid-range or premium tyres are strongly recommended."
