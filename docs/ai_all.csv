- AED 199 is the advertised starting price for a basic oil change and includes a full drain and refill with manufacturer-spec oil, OEM-quality filter replacement, a complimentary vehicle health check, fluid top-ups, tyre pressure check, visual brake and battery checks, reset of the service indicator, a digital service record and an exterior wash. Final price may vary by vehicle model and oil quantity.

2) How often should I change my oil in Dubai?
- Follow your vehicle manufacturer's recommended interval, but because Dubai’s heat is severe, many technicians recommend more frequent changes (commonly around every 5,000–7,500 km or about every 6 months) especially for high-load or short-trip driving. If you’re unsure, ask Glenn or bring your service history and we’ll advise based on your car and driving pattern.

3) What type of oil and filters do you use?
- We use premium fully synthetic oils from trusted brands such as Castrol, Mobil 1, and Liqui Moly, selected to your vehicle’s exact specifications, and we fit OEM-quality (manufacturer-spec) filters — never cheap aftermarket alternatives.

4) Can I wait while you do the oil change?
- Yes — we offer same-day service for oil changes and many customers wait while the job is completed. To be safe, call or WhatsApp ahead to confirm availability and expected turnaround time for your specific vehicle.

5) Will this service affect my warranty and do you keep a service record?

"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/ask-glenn/why-dubai-summers-kill-car-batteries","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) Why do car batteries fail faster in Dubai's heat?
- High temperatures (regularly above 35°C) speed up internal chemical reactions that cause accelerated corrosion, electrolyte evaporation, and increased self-discharge, all of which reduce a battery’s ability to hold a charge and shorten its lifespan.

2) How often should I have my battery tested or replaced in Dubai?
- If your battery is over 2 years old, have it tested every 6 months; many batteries that last 4–5 years in cooler climates may only reach 2–3 years here, and some fail after about 18 months.

3) What are the early warning signs my battery is dying?
- Slow cranking on start, dimming headlights or interior lights, electrical quirks (slow windows, infotainment issues), the battery warning light coming on, and old age are the main indicators you should get checked.

4) What practical steps can I take to extend my battery life?
- Park in shade or underground where possible, avoid leaving devices plugged in when parked, drive regularly so the battery gets charged, and keep terminals clean to minimise corrosion—these measures reduce heat and parasitic drains.

5) Do I need a special battery for Dubai and what does Powerworks offer?
- Batteries designed for hot climates are recommended; Powerworks tests batteries during services, offers replacement options (common prices start from AED 299), uses suitable brands for heat, and disposes of old batteries responsibly without high-pressure sales.","2026-02-12 13:17:38"

Yes — the page advertises genuine parts availability and warranty-protected service. We also follow British Standards and use dealer-level diagnostics.

3) How often should I service my GMC in Dubai?
Service every 8,000–10,000 km or at least once a year. Use quality oil for the V8s to reduce lifter wear, and change transmission fluid every 60,000 km.

4) My Yukon has transmission shudder — what might be wrong and how do you fix it?
Shudder often comes from contaminated transmission fluid or torque converter problems. A fluid flush can fix many cases; more severe shudder may require torque converter or deeper transmission work after diagnosis.

- The AED 199 is the advertised starting price for the AC service and covers the basic AC diagnostic and regas service. The service includes the listed 10+ checks (pressure test, leak detection, compressor check, condenser and evaporator inspection, cabin filter check, temperature verification, etc.). More complex repairs or parts replacements (compressor, hoses, condenser) will incur additional costs — contact them for an exact quote.

2) Which refrigerants do you use for the regas?

- The AED 299 is a starting price that covers the comprehensive engine diagnostic and the 10+ checks listed (fault code scan, compression/leak-down testing, timing inspection, injector/turbo checks, etc.). It does not typically include parts or major repairs; any additional work will be quoted after the diagnosis.

2) What does ""Warranty Protected"" and ""British Standards"" mean for repairs?

3) How long will my engine repair take, and do you offer same-day service?

4) Can you work on turbocharged engines and diesel vehicles?
- Yes. The service covers both petrol and diesel engines and includes turbocharger inspection and injector testing, so turbocharged engines are supported.

5) Is it worth rebuilding my engine or should I replace it?

"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/ask-glenn/warning-signs-cooling-system-failing","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) What should I do immediately if my temperature gauge goes into the red?
- Pull over safely and stop driving as soon as possible. Running the engine while overheated risks head gasket failure or warped heads, which are very expensive to repair. Let the engine cool before checking coolant level or calling for roadside assistance/tow.

2) How can I check for coolant leaks and what do the different colors mean?
- Look for puddles under the car and note the color: green, orange, or pink are common coolant colours and indicate coolant, not oil or fuel. Inspect radiator end tanks, hoses, water pump area, expansion tank, and under the dashboard (heater core) for wet spots or drips. A sweet smell from the engine bay or vents also points to a coolant leak.

3) My oil looks milky under the cap — is that a head gasket failure?
- Milky residue under the oil cap or oil in the coolant usually means coolant is getting into the oil, which often indicates a blown head gasket or a cracked head/block. This is serious and requires prompt inspection; early detection can sometimes avoid full engine replacement. Expect a costly repair compared with routine coolant fixes.

4) How often should I flush or replace coolant in Dubai’s heat?
- The article recommends flushing and replacing coolant every 3–4 years because old coolant becomes acidic and corrosive. Also check coolant level monthly and inspect hoses at every service. Consider proactive thermostat replacement around 100,000 km.

5) Why does my temperature gauge keep fluctuating and is it urgent?
- Fluctuating temperature often comes from air trapped in the system, a sticking thermostat, or an inconsistent water pump. It’s generally easier to diagnose than a constant overheat but shouldn’t be ignored because intermittent cooling can still cause engine damage. Get it checked soon to avoid escalation.","2026-02-12 13:17:38"

A: The service starts from AED 399 and includes a comprehensive checklist with 10+ checks such as complete suspension inspection, shock and strut checks, spring and bushing assessments, control arm and ball joint inspection, tie rod and steering rack checks, plus a wheel alignment check. Final cost depends on required replacements and parts.  

2) Q: How can I tell if my shocks or struts are worn?
A: Common signs are a bouncy or unstable ride, nose-diving under braking, uneven tyre wear, fluid leaks around shocks/struts, or poor handling and pulling to one side. If you notice any of these, a road test and lift inspection will confirm the issue.  

3) Q: Do you use OEM-quality parts and do you check alignment after repairs?
A: Yes — worn parts are replaced with OEM-quality components and a wheel alignment check is performed after suspension work to ensure everything is within spec. This is part of their 5-step, quality-assured process.  

4) Q: Do you service my car make and will you fit lowering springs or other aftermarket parts?
A: They service all major brands (BMW, Mercedes, Toyota, Lexus, Porsche, etc.) as listed on the page. For lowering springs or other aftermarket modifications you should contact them first to confirm compatibility, fitment, and any impact on warranty.  

5) Q: How long will the service take and can it be done the same day?
A: The page advertises same-day service availability, but actual timing depends on diagnosis, parts availability, and workload. Routine inspections and simple repairs can often be completed the same day; major part replacements may require additional time.

"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/makes/rolls-royce","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) Is this an official Rolls‑Royce dealer or an independent specialist?
- They are an independent Rolls‑Royce specialist in Dubai, not an official Rolls‑Royce dealer. The page says they use factory‑trained techniques and dealer‑level (BMW) diagnostics, and they offer warranty‑protected service while using genuine parts where required.

2) How much will a standard Rolls‑Royce service cost here compared to the dealer?
- The page states a standard service is typically 40–50% less than dealer pricing, with major jobs (brakes, suspension) offering even bigger savings. They also promise a detailed upfront quote so there are no surprises.

3) Do they have experience with the Cullinan and V12 engines?
- Yes — they explicitly mention experience with the Cullinan and note it shares a platform with the BMW X7/7 Series. They list V12 engine service (N74), air suspension, and complex electronics among their capabilities.

4) My Rolls‑Royce battery keeps draining — can they diagnose and fix that?
- Yes. They use BMW diagnostic equipment to identify parasitic draws and commonly find faulty modules, door handle mechanisms, or Spirit of Ecstasy illumination as causes. Often it’s a straightforward repair once properly diagnosed.

5) Where are they located, do they offer pickup, and why does the header mention the United Kingdom?
- The workshop is in Al Quoz, Dubai, and they advertise same‑day service plus free pickup. The “United Kingdom”/Goodwood references relate to Rolls‑Royce’s British manufacture and heritage (Goodwood is the factory), not the workshop’s location.","2026-02-12 13:17:41"

2) Are parts genuine and is the work covered by warranty?
Yes — the page states genuine parts are available and the service is warranty protected.

3) How often should I service my Toyota in Dubai?
Standard advice is every 10,000 km or annually; Dubai’s heat stresses cooling and AC systems so sticking to the schedule is important.

4) Does a Toyota Prado need timing belt replacement and how much does it cost?
If it’s the diesel 1KD-FTV, replace the timing belt every 150,000 km or 5 years; the petrol V6 uses a timing chain. The quoted cost for timing belt replacement (including water pump) is about AED 2,500–3,500.

5) How do I book and is there pickup or same-day service?
You can call or WhatsApp 052 121 7425 to book; they offer free pickup and same-day service options depending on the job and parts availability.","2026-02-12 13:17:41"

- The page says they offer genuine parts options and quality parts, but it does not specify warranty terms. For exact warranty coverage on parts and labour, you should ask Powerworks directly when booking or requesting a quote.

3) Where is the workshop and can I get same-day service?
- The workshop is in Dubai Investment Park and the page states same-day availability is offered. Availability can depend on the service required and current bookings, so call or WhatsApp to confirm a same-day slot.

4) What does your fleet service include and how do you minimise downtime?
- Fleet services include dedicated maintenance programs, tracking service history, monitoring wear patterns, priority scheduling, pickup/delivery, detailed reporting and a dedicated account manager. They schedule maintenance to minimise operational disruption and help forecast costs and replacement timing based on actual condition.

5) Why should I service my car more often in Dubai?
- Dubai’s extreme heat, hot road surfaces, fine desert sand and heavy stop‑start traffic accelerate oil degradation, stress cooling systems, degrade batteries/AC components, and wear brakes and clutches faster. Powerworks adjusts service intervals and inspects heat- and sand-prone parts (coolant hoses, suspension bushings, electrical connections, timing belts) to prevent major failures and protect your investment.","2026-02-12 13:17:41"
"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/car-servicing-dubai/tyre-replacement-dubai","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) What does the AED 250 starting price include?
- The AED 250 is a starting price for tyre replacement and covers professional mounting, precision balancing, a new valve, a complimentary alignment check, old tyre disposal, and the multi-point tyre condition checks. Tyre supply is extra and depends on the brand, size and model you choose, so final cost varies.

2) How long do tyres typically last in Dubai?
- Tyre life in Dubai depends on heat, driving style, road conditions and maintenance, but you can generally expect 3–5 years or roughly 25,000–50,000 km for many tyres. Regular inflation checks, wheel balancing and alignment will extend life, and you should replace tyres when tread depth or damage becomes unsafe.

3) Should I replace all four tyres at once?
- It’s best to replace all four on all-wheel-drive vehicles to avoid drivetrain stress; for two-wheel-drive cars, replacing in matched pairs (both front or both rear) is often acceptable. If tyre wear is uneven or a tyre is significantly older, replacing all four gives the safest, most consistent handling.

4) Do you provide wheel alignment and balancing?
- Yes — every tyre fitting includes precision wheel balancing, a new valve and a complimentary alignment check to verify alignment is within specification. If a full alignment adjustment is required, the team can perform or arrange the alignment service (confirm at booking).

5) Do you fit tyres for luxury and exotic cars?
- Yes — the garage services all major brands, including BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, Rolls‑Royce, Ferrari, Lamborghini and more, using modern equipment that protects your wheels. They supply premium brands (Michelin, Pirelli, Continental, Bridgestone) and can recommend tyres based on your vehicle and driving needs.","2026-02-12 13:17:42"

"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/makes/audi","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) How often should my Audi's DSG gearbox be serviced?
- The page recommends servicing DSG every 40,000 km (especially in Dubai). Audi's ""lifetime fill"" claim is considered optimistic in hot climates because heat degrades the fluid faster. Regular fluid changes are far cheaper than repairing DSG mechatronics.

2) My 2.0 TFSI rattles on cold start — is that serious?
- Yes, it can be serious; the page flags a common fault with timing chain tensioners on 2008–2013 2.0 TFSI engines. If the chain skips it can catastrophically damage the engine, so you should get it checked immediately. Early repair is much simpler and cheaper than a full engine replacement.

3) Will servicing at this garage void my Audi warranty?
- No — UAE law allows independent servicing if manufacturer specifications are followed. The garage states they use approved oil grades, genuine filters where required, and document all work, so keep receipts as proof of proper maintenance.

4) Do they use genuine parts and proper diagnostics for Audis?
- Yes — they advertise genuine parts availability and use Audi ODIS dealer-level diagnostics. Technicians are factory-trained in Audi systems like Quattro, DSG/S‑Tronic and TFSI engines.

5) What are typical service costs and how can I book or get pickup?
- The page lists example prices (e.g., oil change AED 199, full car service AED 349, diagnostics AED 150) and offers same-day service and free pickup. To book or get a quote you can call or WhatsApp 052 121 7425.","2026-02-12 13:17:43"

"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/car-servicing-dubai/battery-replacement-dubai","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) How long do car batteries typically last in Dubai?
- Due to Dubai's extreme heat, batteries here often fail within 2–3 years, which is why regular checks and using premium brands (Varta, Bosch, AC Delco) are recommended.

2) What is included in the AED 299 starting price?
- The starting price includes a premium battery (matched to your vehicle), professional fitting, battery capacity and charging system checks, a starter and parasitic drain test, terminal cleaning, memory saver use, system reset if needed, and responsible disposal of your old battery.

3) Do you provide roadside battery replacement or same-day service?
- Yes — the page advertises same-day service and free fitting; if you need roadside assistance it’s best to call or WhatsApp them to confirm availability and dispatch details.

4) Will I lose my radio code and vehicle settings when the battery is replaced?
- No — they use a memory saver during the swap to preserve radio codes and vehicle settings, and they’ll reset any battery monitoring systems after installation.

5) How do you ensure the new battery is the correct one and the car’s electrical system is healthy?
- Their 5-step process includes testing your current battery (capacity and CCA), checking the alternator and charging system, matching the correct size and terminal type, professional fitting, and final verification with system resets as required.","2026-02-12 13:17:43"

- Yes. The shop states it services all Ford models including Mustang, Bronco, F‑150 and Explorer, and has experience with platform‑shared vehicles like the Bronco/Ranger.

2) What common Ford problems should owners in Dubai watch for?
- Common issues listed are EcoBoost carbon buildup, turbocharger wear (heat stresses turbos), transmission shudder on 10‑speed units, and timing‑chain wear. Regular oil, cooling and carbon‑clean maintenance are recommended.

3) What diagnostics and repair capabilities do you have?
- They use Ford IDS dealer‑level diagnostics, perform EcoBoost turbo service, 10‑speed transmission work, Mustang performance tuning, and electrical diagnostics. Technicians apply factory‑trained techniques and offer same‑day service where possible.

"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/car-servicing-dubai/electrical-diagnostics-dubai","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) What does the AED 150 starting price cover?
- AED 150 is the starting charge for the electrical diagnostics service and covers the basic diagnostic work such as a full OBD-II scan, manufacturer-specific fault code reading, and an initial live data review. Additional tests (extensive component testing, parts, or complex wiring work) can increase the final price. You’ll get a detailed diagnostic report and a quote for any recommended repairs. Contact them for an exact quote for your vehicle.

2) Can you diagnose my specific car make and model?
- Yes — the garage advertises diagnostics for all major brands and uses dealer-level, manufacturer-specific tools to read codes from every module. The page lists many makes (BMW, Mercedes, Toyota, Ferrari, etc.), and they state “All Makes Welcome.” If you’re unsure, provide your make/model when you call or WhatsApp to confirm.

3) How long will the diagnostics take — is same-day service available?
- Same-day service is offered, but total time depends on the fault’s complexity. A basic scan and live-data check can be completed quickly, while component testing and parasitic drain investigations may take longer. The team will give an estimated timeline when you book based on the reported symptoms.

4) Do you offer any warranty or guarantees on the diagnostic work?
- The page notes “Warranty Protected” and adherence to British Standards, indicating they back their work, but it doesn’t detail specific warranty terms. For exact coverage, duration, and what’s included (diagnosis only vs. repair warranty), ask them directly when booking. They’ll provide the warranty specifics relevant to your service.

5) How accurate are your diagnostics and will you replace parts unnecessarily?
- They use dealer-level diagnostic equipment, live data analysis, and individual component testing to identify the root cause, which reduces guesswork and unnecessary part replacement. You receive a clear diagnostic report and repair options so you can approve only required work. Their process is designed to save money by confirming faults before replacing parts.","2026-02-12 13:17:42"
"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/makes/mercedes","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) Do you use genuine Mercedes parts?
Yes — the shop keeps genuine Mercedes parts available and uses them where it matters, while offering quality OEM alternatives when appropriate. Services are warranty protected.  

2) How much will I save compared with going to a dealer?
According to the page, their work typically costs 30–50% less than dealer prices for the same quality of work. Much of the saving comes from accurate diagnostics and fixing the actual fault rather than replacing parts unnecessarily.  

3) What common Mercedes problems can they fix?
They handle AIRMATIC suspension leaks and compressor faults, 9G‑TRONIC transmission servicing, balance shaft issues on M272/M273 engines, transmission conductor plate failures, camshaft adjuster problems, electrical/battery drain diagnostics, brakes, AC, and general servicing.  

4) Where are they and how do I book a service?
They’re located in Al Quoz, Dubai. You can call or WhatsApp 052 121 7425 to book; the page also mentions free pickup and same‑day service availability.  

5) My Mercedes battery keeps going flat—can they diagnose that?
Yes — they use Mercedes XENTRY diagnostics to identify which module is drawing power (common culprits: SAM modules, seat control units, aftermarket accessories). Often the fix is a software reset or a modestly priced part (the page cites around €200) rather than replacing the whole battery.","2026-02-12 13:17:43"

- We’re in Al Quoz, Dubai. Bookings and inquiries via phone or WhatsApp at 052 121 7425. Free pickup is available for Ferrari customers.

2) Will servicing my Ferrari with you affect the manufacturer’s warranty?
- We offer warranty-protected service and use dealer-level diagnostics and genuine parts, but some manufacturers insist on dealer-only work for warranty claims. If your car is under a specific warranty, tell us up front so we can advise whether independent servicing is acceptable.

3) How much does Ferrari servicing cost with you?
- Independent Ferrari work is typically 30–50% cheaper than dealer rates; a major service that might be AED 15,000+ at a dealer could be around AED 8,000–10,000 here. We also list common service prices (e.g., oil change AED 199, general car service AED 349, electrical diagnostics AED 150).

"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/ask-glenn/10000km-service-myth","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) Why don't manufacturer service intervals work for Dubai?
Manufacturer intervals assume ""normal"" conditions (moderate temps, highway driving). Dubai has extreme heat, constant stop-start traffic, short trips that don’t reach full operating temperature, lots of dust/sand, and constant AC load — all classed as ""severe"" service conditions that accelerate oil and component degradation.

2) What service intervals do you recommend for Dubai driving?
Recommended intervals in the article: engine oil every 8,000–10,000 km, oil filter with every oil change, air filter every 15,000–20,000 km, cabin filter every 10,000–15,000 km, brake fluid no more than every 2 years, and coolant every 3–4 years.

3) Will following these shorter intervals void my warranty?
Generally no — shortening service intervals won’t void a warranty as long as you use oils and parts that meet manufacturer specifications and keep detailed service records and invoices. Always check your specific warranty terms or ask your dealer if you’re unsure.

4) Is the extra cost actually worth it?
Yes: over 100,000 km the article compares AED ~1,600 following manufacturer oil intervals versus ~AED 4,000 following Dubai intervals — an extra AED ~2,400 to avoid much larger engine repairs that can cost tens of thousands. Shorter intervals are essentially inexpensive insurance against accelerated wear and sludge damage.

5) What does Powerworks include in a service and how do I book or ask questions?
Powerworks includes quality oil meeting or exceeding manufacturer specs, genuine or OEM-quality filters, a multi-point inspection, complimentary fluid top-ups, and an honest report on immediate vs. later needs.

"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/ask-glenn/should-you-buy-used-european-car-dubai","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) Is it a good idea to buy a used European car in Dubai?
Yes — it can be excellent value because European cars depreciate rapidly here, but only if you buy the right model, get a proper pre-purchase inspection, and budget for ongoing maintenance. Without those precautions it can quickly become a costly ownership experience.

2) How much should I budget annually for maintenance?
Expect roughly AED 5,000–10,000 for mid-size BMW/Mercedes sedans, AED 5,000–12,000 for many Audis/VWs, AED 10,000–20,000 for Porsches, AED 12,000–25,000 for Range Rovers, and AED 15,000–30,000 for high‑performance BMW/AMG models. These figures are for quality independent garages; dealer servicing is typically 40–60% more expensive.

3) Which European models are generally good buys and which should I avoid?
Good buys listed include BMW 3/5 Series (F30/F10), Mercedes E‑Class (W212/W213), Porsche Cayenne (958/9YA) and Audi Q5/Q7 if well maintained. Proceed with caution on Range Rover/Range Rover Sport (air suspension), older BMW X5/X6 V8s (cooling/timing chain), Mercedes S‑Class W221 (complex electronics), and any diesel without a full service history.

4) What does a pre-purchase inspection check and how much does it cost?
A proper inspection checks full service history, does a diagnostic scan, inspects suspension/steering, cooling system, transmission behavior on a road test, undercarriage for leaks/damage, and electrical systems. Powerworks’ inspections cost AED 500–750, take 60–90 minutes, and can save you tens of thousands by exposing hidden issues.

5) What are the biggest risks to watch for when buying a used European car in Dubai?
Key risks are missing or incomplete service history, cooling‑system failures from the heat, costly suspension or air‑suspension repairs, complex electrical/electronic faults, and diesel‑system issues (injectors/DPF) if the car hasn’t been properly serviced. High market turnover from expats and lease returns also means many cars are sold quickly without thorough upkeep.","2026-02-12 13:17:43"
"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/makes/volkswagen","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) What Volkswagen services do you offer?
We handle full VW care including VAS/ODIS dealer-level diagnostics, DSG transmission service, TSI/TDI engine work, 4MOTION system service, general car servicing, AC repair/regas, oil changes, electrical diagnostics, brakes and suspension. Genuine parts are available and same-day work is often possible.

2) How often should I service my DSG gearbox?
Change the DSG fluid about every 40,000 km. VW’s “lifetime fill” claim doesn’t hold up in Dubai’s heat, and skipping services leads to jerky shifts and possible mechatronic failure.

3) Are genuine VW parts available in Dubai and are they expensive?
Yes — genuine OEM parts are available and reasonably priced, and there are good quality aftermarket/OEM-equivalent alternatives. VW group parts are shared across brands (Audi, Skoda, SEAT), which helps keep costs down.

4) My VW makes a rattling noise on startup — should I worry?
Yes — on older TSI engines (especially 1.8 and 2.0 from 2008–2013) a rattling startup often indicates timing chain tensioner failure, which can destroy the engine if ignored. On newer cars it might be something minor like a loose heat shield, but you should get it checked promptly.

5) Where are you located and how do I book a service?
We’re in Al Quoz, Dubai, and offer free pickup with warranty-protected service. Call or WhatsApp 052 121 7425 to book; example prices listed include oil change AED 199 and full car service from AED 349.","2026-02-12 13:17:44"

- Refrigerant is contained in a sealed system; it only decreases if there's a leak. Regular loss means a leak must be found and repaired — adding gas without fixing the leak is a temporary and wasteful fix.

2) How can I tell if my AC problem is a leak or something else?
- Common signs of a leak include low system pressures on a gauge, visible oil or dye at joints, and AC that cools briefly then stops. Diagnostics like pressure testing and electronic/UV leak detection are the reliable ways to confirm a leak.

3) How much does a regas cost and is it ever worthwhile?
- A basic regas in Dubai is often quoted around AED 200–400, but it’s only worthwhile if the system is intact. If there's a leak or failed component, you’ll need that repaired first or the regas will quickly fail.

4) What are the typical symptoms of compressor, condenser, expansion valve, or electrical faults?
- Compressor: intermittent cooling, strange noises, clutch not engaging. Condenser: cool while driving but warm at idle, poor performance in traffic, visible debris/damage. Expansion valve: alternating cold/warm, frost on lines, hissing sounds. Electrical: blown fuses, faulty relays, or wiring issues causing sudden or total loss of function.

5) What can I do to prevent AC problems in Dubai’s climate?
- Run the AC for about 10 minutes once a week to keep seals lubricated, have the condenser inspected/cleaned annually, replace the cabin filter regularly, and ventilate the car briefly before setting the AC to max. These steps reduce strain and lower the chance of failures.","2026-02-12 13:17:44"

"https://www.powerworksgarage.com/ask-glenn/truth-about-lifetime-transmission-fluid","text/html; charset=utf-8","200","OK","Non-Indexable","Canonicalised","1) What does ""lifetime"" transmission fluid actually mean?
- ""Lifetime"" usually means the fluid is expected to last the transmission’s warranty life (typically ~4–5 years or ~100,000 km), not the car’s entire life. It’s a marketing shorthand and doesn’t account for extreme conditions like Dubai’s heat, which accelerates fluid degradation.

2) How often should I change transmission fluid in Dubai?
- Recommended intervals from the article: standard automatics every 60,000–80,000 km; high-performance driving every 40,000–60,000 km; heavy use (towing/off-road) every 30,000–40,000 km; CVTs every 40,000–60,000 km. You may want to shorten intervals if you frequently drive in very hot conditions or under heavy load.

3) What are the common signs my transmission fluid needs attention?
- Watch for delayed or rough shifting, slipping (engine revs without proper acceleration), shuddering during gear changes, whining or humming noises, and fluid that is dark or smells burnt. Fresh fluid is typically red/pink; dark brown or black indicates degradation.

4) What does a proper transmission fluid service involve at Powerworks?
- They use manufacturer-specified fluid, replace the filter if applicable, check old fluid for metal particles to spot wear early, and reset adaptation values when needed (important for many German cars). They don’t just drain-and-fill, aiming for a more thorough service.

5) Is it worth changing ""lifetime"" fluid given the cost?
- Yes: a fluid change (AED 500–1,500) is inexpensive compared with a rebuild (AED 8,000–15,000) or replacement (AED 15,000–40,000+). Regular changes are cheap insurance against catastrophic failure, especially in hot climates where fluid degrades faster.","2026-02-12 13:17:44"

2) What is the IMS bearing issue and which cars are at risk?
The Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing can fail catastrophically on 1997–2008 Boxster/Cayman (986/987) and 1999–2005 911 (996/early 997). They can usually inspect the IMS without major disassembly and recommend an upgraded bearing during clutch work as preventive maintenance.
