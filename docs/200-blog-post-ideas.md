## Recommended Publishing Strategy

### Phase 1 — Quick Wins (Month 1-2): 20 posts
Focus on high-SV keywords where you can rank fast:
- Posts #36, 37, 157, 172, 201, 202 (SV 590-1,900)
- All Dubai-specific cost guides
- Symptom-based posts (people searching for these need a garage NOW)

### Phase 2 — Brand Authority (Month 3-4): 40 posts
- BMW, Mercedes, Range Rover articles (high CPC, qualified leads)
- Pre-purchase inspection content (drives direct bookings)
- Dubai climate series (unique content = easy to rank)

### Phase 3 — Topical Authority (Month 5-8): 80 posts
- Complete the maintenance, symptoms, and how-to categories
- Build out brand-specific content for all 26 makes
- Fleet and business content for B2B leads

### Phase 4 — Long Tail (Month 9-12): 100 posts
- Fill remaining categories
- Seasonal content (summer/Ramadan/Eid car care)
- EV/hybrid future-proofing content

### GMB Posting Strategy
- Post 3-4 times per week on GMB
- Use the **GMB-marked** posts (114 total = ~7 months of content)
- Each GMB post should include: eye-catching image, first 2 sentences of the blog, CTA to read more
- Add "Book Now" or "Call" button linking to WhatsApp

### Internal Linking Strategy
- Every blog post should link to the relevant service page (e.g., AC article → /car-servicing-dubai/ac-repair-dubai)
- Every brand article should link to /makes/[brand]
- Cross-link related articles within each category
- Add "Related Articles" sidebar (already implemented)
