Create location-specific service pages (Al Quoz, JLT, Marina, etc.)
Add more "Ask Glenn" articles targeting high-volume keywords
Create brand+service combo pages (e.g., "BMW AC Repair Dubai")
2. Target Higher-Volume Keywords
Powerworks' best keyword: "ac automotive repair near me" (4,400/mo) at position 73
ServiceMyCar: "car wash near me" (110,000/mo) at position 9

Target keywords with 1,000+ monthly searches:

"car service dubai"
"car mechanic near me"
"auto repair dubai"
"bmw service dubai"
3. Local SEO Expansion
ServiceMyCar ranks in multiple Emirates. Consider:

Add Sharjah service area pages
Add Abu Dhabi pickup/delivery pages
Create neighborhood-specific pages
4. Schema Improvements (Already Implemented ✅)
The schema enhancements we just deployed will help with:

Rich snippets in search results

1,066 keywords vs your 90
Strong brand+service pages
