# Frontend Design Skill Overview

This skill enables creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that prioritize high design quality and avoid generic aesthetics.

## Key Principles

**Design Thinking**: Before coding, establish a bold aesthetic direction by understanding purpose, selecting a clear tone (brutalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, etc.), and identifying what makes the design memorable.

**Critical Guidance**: "Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity."

## Implementation Focus Areas

- **Typography**: Employ distinctive, characterful fonts rather than defaults; pair a display font with a refined body option
- **Color & Theme**: Use cohesive palettes with dominant colors and sharp accents via CSS variables
- **Motion**: Prioritize high-impact moments like staggered page-load reveals and scroll-triggered interactions
- **Composition**: Employ asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, and generous negative space
- **Details**: Add atmosphere through gradients, textures, patterns, and context-specific effects

## What to Avoid

The guidelines explicitly warn against overused elements: generic font families, clichéd color schemes (like purple gradients), predictable layouts, and "cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character."

The skill emphasizes that "Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work"—encouraging bold, context-driven solutions rather than conventional approaches.
